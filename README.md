# Bayesian-Inference-of-Network-Structure-with-Noisy-Data

BAYESIAN STATISTIC PROJECT A.Y. 2020-2021

Our project is about Bayesian inference for network structure with noisy data.  
We make inference about data Xij that represent interaction between students. From this data we want to infer a network, with 0,1 value, that indicates friendship links between the students.
We used four models:

* __Poisson Model - Erdős-Rényi Network Model__
* __Negative Binomial Model - Erdős-Rényi Network Model__
* __Negative Binomial Model - Stochastic Block Model__
* __Poisson Model - Multi-edge Model__
